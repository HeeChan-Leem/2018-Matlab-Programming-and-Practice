Day/Time: Friday, 2:00PM - 5:00PM<br>
Location: P211<br>
Office hours: Friday, 5:00PM - 6:00PM @ P716
Grading: midterm (30%) + final (30%) + assignments (35%) + participation (5%)

This term we will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/hongik.ac.kr/fall2018/01231318/home) to answer questions and post announcements about the course. Students' use of Piazza, particularly for adequately answering other students' questions, will contribute toward their participation grade.

#### Course Description

------

The course, intended for students with no programming experience, provides a complete introduction to programming in MATLAB. Variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, functions, plots, and more advanced methods are explained. The course aims at teaching the required skills to use MATLAB in their own work, and be prepared to deepen their MATLAB programming skills and tackle other languages for computing.
